# Potato Plant Disease Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for classifying potato plant diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is built using the `tensorflow.keras` library and is designed to perform classification tasks. It includes various layers such as batch normalization, dense layers, dropout layers, and the softmax activation function in the output layer.

## Overview

The notebook includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model building and training
- Evaluation and visualization of results
